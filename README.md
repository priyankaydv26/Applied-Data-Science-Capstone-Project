# Applied-Data-Science-Capstone-Project
# **SpaceX  Falcon 9 first stage Landing Prediction**
This capstone project consists of various stages of a data science project accompanied by SpaceX dataset.

# Lab 1: Collecting the data
## Objectives
In this lab, you will make a get request to the SpaceX API. You will also do some basic data wrangling and formating. 
- Request to the SpaceX API
- Clean the requested data

# Lab 1.2: Web scraping Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy Launches Records from Wikipedia
## Objectives
Web scrap Falcon 9 launch records with `BeautifulSoup`: 
- Extract a Falcon 9 launch records HTML table from Wikipedia
- Parse the table and convert it into a Pandas data frame

# Lab 2: Data wrangling
## Objectives
Perform exploratory  Data Analysis and determine Training Labels
-   Exploratory Data Analysis
-   Determine Training Labels

# Lab 3: EDA and Data Visualization
# Lab 3.1: Complete the EDA with SQL

# Lab 3.2: EDA with Visualization Lab

# Lab 3.3: Interactive Visual Analytics with Folium lab

# Lab 3.4: Build an Interactive Dashboard with Ploty Dash

# Lab 4: Machine Learning Prediction
## Objectives
Perform exploratory  Data Analysis and determine Training Labels
*   create a column for the class
*   Standardize the data
*   Split into training data and test data
*   Find best Hyperparameter for SVM, Classification Trees and Logistic Regression
*   Find the method performs best using test data
